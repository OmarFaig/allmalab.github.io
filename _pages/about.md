Welcome to the website of the Kann Natural Language Processing Group (NALA) at CU Boulder!
We develop computational models for the understanding or generation of natural language. Some of our current areas of interest are:

- Universal natural language processing and transfer learning
- Natural language processing for educational applications
- Computational morphology
- Low-resource machine translation
- Language grounding
- Natural language processing for medical applications

More details can be found <a href="/projects/">here</a>. Please also check out the websites of <a href="http://turing.iimas.unam.mx/americasnlp" target="_blank">NLP for Indigenous Languages of the Americas (AmericasNLP)</a> and the <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/coco4mt" target="_blank">First Workshop on Corpus Generation and Corpus Augmentation for Machine Translation (CoCo4MT)</a>, which members of NALA are co-organizing!
