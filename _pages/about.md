Welcome to the website of the von der Wense Natural Language Processing Group (NALA), whose two homes are <a href="https://www.colorado.edu" target="_blank">University of Colorado Boulder</a>, USA, and <a href="https://homepage.uni-mainz.de" target="_blank">Johannes Gutenberg University Mainz</a>, Germany!
We develop computational models for the understanding or generation of natural language. Some of our current areas of interest are:

- Universal natural language processing and transfer learning
- Natural language processing for educational applications
- Computational morphology
- Low-resource machine translation
- Language grounding
- Natural language processing for medical applications
