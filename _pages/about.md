Welcome to the website of the Kann Natural Language Processing Group (NALA) at CU Boulder!
We develop computational models for the understanding or generation of natural language. Some of our current areas of interest are:

- Universal natural language processing and transfer learning
- Natural language processing for educational applications
- Computational morphology
- Low-resource machine translation
- Language grounding
- Natural language processing for medical applications

More details can be found <a href="/projects/">here</a>. Please also check out the websites of the <a href="http://turing.iimas.unam.mx/americasnlp" target="_blank">First Workshop on NLP for Indigenous Languages of the Americas (AmericasNLP)</a>, the <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/loresmt" target="_blank">Fourth Workshop on Technologies for MT of Low Resource Languages (LoResMT 2021)</a> and the <a href="https://weasul.github.io" target="_blank">ICLR 2021 Workshop on Weakly Supervised Learning (WeaSuL)</a>, which members of our group were co-organizing!
