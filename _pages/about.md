Welcome to the website of CU Boulderâ€™s Natural Language Processing (NALA) Group!
We develop computational models for the understanding or generation of natural language. Some of our current <a href="/projects/">areas of interest</a> are:

- Universal natural language processing and transfer learning
- Natural language processing for educational applications
- Computational morphology
- Low-resource machine translation
- Language grounding

Please also check out the website of the <a href="http://turing.iimas.unam.mx/americasnlp" target="_blank">First Workshop on NLP for Indigenous Languages of the Americas (AmericasNLP)</a>, which members of our group are co-organizing!
