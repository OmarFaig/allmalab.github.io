At NALA, we <b>do</b>:
<ul>
<li> support each other and value effort even if we obtain negative results!</li>
<li> only publish work we are proud of!</li>
<li> release code used for the experiments in our papers within 6 months after the paperâ€™s publication!</li>
<li> consider the ethical implications of our work!</li>
<li> respect everyone's work<span>&#8211;</span>life balance!</li>
<li> make an effort to recruit and hire a diverse group of lab members!</li>
</ul>

<br>

At NALA, we <b>don't</b>:
<ul>
<li> let perfect be the enemy of good!</li>
