- name: Katharina Kann
  description: I’m an Assistant Professor of Computer Science at CU Boulder, where I work on natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning. Research-wise, I am interested in multilingual NLP (how can we make NLP systems work for all of the world’s languages?), transfer learning (how can models use knowledge gained from a source task for a target task?), and computational morphology (how can models learn about and leverage subword information?). More generally, circumstances permitting, I spend a lot of my time traveling, dancing, hiking, biking, and scuba diving, and I love sushi, ice cream and watermelons.

- name: Shiran Dudy
  description: I am a postdoc in computer science at CU Boulder, where I focus on natural language processing (NLP) and reinforcement learning (RL). I am participating in the institute for student-AI teaming project (iSAT) where we investigate how to integrate digital assistants into a classroom setting. I am also interested in finding ways to address diversity in natural language generation (NLG), addressing algorithmic biases, working towards continual learning models (particularly in NLP), and accessibility and augmentative and alternative communication (AAC).
      Outside of work I like practicing yoga, hiking, reading, cooking, and also just hanging out with friends. :-)

- name: Stephane Aroca-ouellette
  description: After completing my undergrad at University of Toronto in computer engineering, I pursued my masters in computer science with a focus on natural language processing. While investigating new auxiliary tasks for BERT pre-training, I saw the power of modern language models while learning the inherent limitation of inhabiting purely textual environments. Co-advised by Alessandro Roncone and Katharina Kann, I am now working towards my PhD at CU Boulder to answer how robotics can help ground language in the real world and how language can help our interaction and collaboration with robots.

- name: Adam Wiemerslage
  description: I am a first-year PhD student in computer science advised by Katharina Kann. My research interests are in natural language processing, particularly relating to computational morphology, under-represented languages, and multilingual models. I am especially interested in machine learning models that draw upon or explore linguistic insights. Previously I was a research scientist in industry, and before that I spent a year at a government laboratory, which has given me broad experience in various subareas of NLP. In my free time, I strive to be a good Coloradoan by hiking/biking/camping/climbing as well as brewing/tasting beer.

- name: Sagi Shaier
  description: Currently a PhD student at CU Boulder, advised by Katharina Kann and Lawrence Hunter. I completed my undergraduate degree in computational and applied mathematics on the pre-med track with a focus on epidemiology. Later I worked in the industry for about 1.5 years in various machine learning & data science positions. My sights are set on using the intersection of artificial intelligence and neuroscience to improve people’s lives. My research interests are artificial general intelligence, dialogue systems, knowledge graphs, factuality, dynamic systems, continual learning, online learning, and biologically inspired algorithms. More specifically, developing medical dialogue systems that are factual, interpretable, validatable, and incorporate knowledge graphs. Outside of academia I spend most of my time practicing Muay Thai, hiking with my puppy, baking, and going on spontaneous road trips.

  description: This fall I will be a fourth-year undergraduate in computer science, with a minor in linguistics. I am mostly interested in the fields of NLP and computational linguistics, and their applications in increasing accessibility for disadvantaged communities. This last year I worked with the RISE IRT through the Discovery Learning Apprenticeship (DLA), where I learned how to use ArcGIS and RStudio to analyse the unique vulnerability and hazard exposure of incarceration facilities in the United States. Prior to university, I spent a gap year in Taipei to study Mandarin Chinese, and in my free time I enjoy trying to not lose my Chinese, reading, skiing, cooking, and any/all river activities.
