- name: Katharina Kann
  description: I’m an Assistant Professor of Computer Science at CU Boulder, where I am teaching and doing research on natural language processing (NLP). Research-wise, I am interested in multilingual NLP (how can we make NLP systems work for all of the world’s languages?), transfer learning (how can models use knowledge gained from a source task for a target task?), and computational morphology (how can models learn about and leverage subword information?). More generally, circumstances permitting, I spend a lot of my time traveling, dancing, hiking, and biking, and I love sushi, ice cream and watermelons.

- name: Connor Cook
  description: I am a Master's student at CU Boulder. I spent some time in the AML Lab at Brigham Young University as an undergraduate (see https://github.com/byu-aml-lab), and spent my first year at CU Boulder as a research assistant in the D'Mello Lab (see https://www.colorado.edu/ics/research/dmello-lab). I have experience in a couple different areas of natural language processing, but dialog systems (also known as chatbots) have become my most recent area of interest.

- name: Rajat Bhatnagar
  description: Hi, I'm a second year master student in Computer Science. My research interests are broadly in interpretability and machine translation. I spent my Summer 2020 doing an internship at Apple in the special projects team. Before coming to Boulder I've had work experience of 3.5 years working as a full stack developer in a startup company named Fastfox in India. I love to play outdoor sports like badminton, soccer and cricket.

- name: Ananya Ganesh
  description: I am a first year PhD student advised by Profs. Katharina Kann and Martha Palmer. I am interested in NLP and machine learning, and I’m currently working on dialog systems applied to classroom settings. Previously, I was a research engineer in the NLP & Speech Research group at Educational Testing Service (ETS), working on automated scoring. I earned an MS in CS from UMass Amherst in May 2019, where I was a part of the Information Extraction and Synthesis Lab.

- name: Stephane Aroca-ouellette
  description: After completing my undergrad at University of Toronto in computer engineering, I pursued my masters in computer science with a focus on natural language processing. While investigating new auxiliary tasks for BERT pre-training, I saw the power of modern language models while learning the inherent limitation of inhabiting purely textual environments. Co-advised by Alessandro Roncone and Katharina Kann, I am now working towards my PhD at CU Boulder to answer how robotics can help ground language in the real world and how language can help our interaction and collaboration with robots.

- name: Adam Wiemerslage
  description: I am a first year PhD student in computer science advised by Katharina Kann. My research interests are in natural language processing, particularly relating to computational morphology, under-represented languages, and multilingual models. I am especially interested in machine learning models that draw upon or explore linguistic insights. Previously I was a research scientist in industry, and before that I spent a year at a government laboratory, which has given me broad experience in various subareas of NLP. In my free time, I strive to be a good Coloradoan by hiking/biking/camping/climbing as well as brewing/tasting beer.
