- name: Katharina Kann
  description: I’m an Assistant Professor of Computer Science at CU Boulder, where I work on natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning. Research-wise, I am interested in multilingual NLP (how can we make NLP systems work for all of the world’s languages?), transfer learning (how can models use knowledge gained from a source task for a target task?), and computational morphology (how can models learn about and leverage subword information?). More generally, circumstances permitting, I spend a lot of my time traveling, dancing, hiking, and biking, and I love sushi, ice cream and watermelons.

- name: Shiran Dudy
  description: I am a postdoc in computer science at CU Boulder, where I focus on natural language processing (NLP) and reinforcement learning (RL). I am participating in the institute for student-AI teaming project (iSAT) where we investigate how to integrate digital assistants into a classroom setting. I am also interested in finding ways to address diversity in natural language generation (NLG), addressing algorithmic biases, working towards continual learning models (particularly in NLP), and accessibility and augmentative and alternative communication (AAC).
      Outside of work I like practicing yoga, hiking, reading, cooking, and also just hanging out with friends. :-)

- name: Ananya Ganesh
  description: I am a first year PhD student advised by Profs. Katharina Kann and Martha Palmer. I'm broadly interested in natural language processing as applied to educational settings, and I’m currently working on developing NLP models to understand and improve classroom discourse. Previously, I was a research engineer in the NLP & Speech Research group at the Educational Testing Service (ETS) and I received a Master's in Computer Science from UMass Amherst. In my free time, I enjoy reading fantasy fiction, solving puzzles, and exploring Boulder.

- name: Stephane Aroca-ouellette
  description: After completing my undergrad at University of Toronto in computer engineering, I pursued my masters in computer science with a focus on natural language processing. While investigating new auxiliary tasks for BERT pre-training, I saw the power of modern language models while learning the inherent limitation of inhabiting purely textual environments. Co-advised by Alessandro Roncone and Katharina Kann, I am now working towards my PhD at CU Boulder to answer how robotics can help ground language in the real world and how language can help our interaction and collaboration with robots.

- name: Adam Wiemerslage
  description: I am a first year PhD student in computer science advised by Katharina Kann. My research interests are in natural language processing, particularly relating to computational morphology, under-represented languages, and multilingual models. I am especially interested in machine learning models that draw upon or explore linguistic insights. Previously I was a research scientist in industry, and before that I spent a year at a government laboratory, which has given me broad experience in various subareas of NLP. In my free time, I strive to be a good Coloradoan by hiking/biking/camping/climbing as well as brewing/tasting beer.

  description: I am a first-year master student in computer science at CU Boulder. My research interests are in the development of AI systems that are able to comprehend the natural world in profound ways. My current project is investigating the behavior of NLP models within this context. Prior to this, I completed my undergraduate in computer science here at CU.

- name: Pragna Mandadi
  description: Hi, I'm a first year Masters in Computer Science Student. I'm interested in developing multilayered and multidimensional AI systems that focus on revolutionizing the way modern problems are solved. Currently I'm working on a question reformulation project to enhance the model's ability to perceive and understand context so that the model can answer questions derived from a paragraph or a comprehension more accurately. Prior to this I've had an industry experience of 2.5 years at Citicorp Services as an Application Developer. In my free time I enjoy watching TV shows and socializing with people.

  description: I'm a third-year undergraduate student, just starting to explore NLP. I'm interested in semantic analysis, text generation, and adaptive models -- to name a few. Currently I'm working on an independent study project to determine whether language models and young second-language learners show similarities in the mistakes they make using English.
