  description: I am a Master's student at CU Boulder. I spent some time in the AML Lab at Brigham Young University as an undergraduate (see https://github.com/byu-aml-lab), and spent my first year at CU Boulder as a research assistant in the D'Mello Lab (see https://www.colorado.edu/ics/research/dmello-lab). I have experience in a couple different areas of natural language processing, but dialog systems (also known as chatbots) have become my most recent area of interest.
